2dF (and 6dF) field configuration delta task.  

This software has made use of the ESO cmm system (known internally
at AAO as "acmm").  

This module is a DRAMA module - it must have a dmakefile and not
a Makefile.  This will be checked when you archive the module.


This module,  2dFdelta, was created from an old SCCS archive.
Version 3.0 is a snapshot taken when it was put into 
ACMM on Mon Mar 10 11:22:36 2003
